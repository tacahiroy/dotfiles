# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's

# move around panes with j and k, a bit like vim
# as of tmux 1.1, there is no way to move based on pane position (ie, no way to
# move the pane to the right)

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
